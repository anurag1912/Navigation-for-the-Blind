A system designed to aid free and fearless movement of the visually challenged in seemingly unknown environments.
The system uses a GPS module, digital compass for orientation, ultrasonic sensors and vibrating motors for feedback. 
The system is built using the Gumstix Verdex Pro platform running a flavour of Linux RTOS on the ARM processor.
Designed kernel modules for interfacing the sensors and actuators with the MCU.
Also designed user level programs to simulate the system with raw data obtained from the sensors and the GPS data. 
Do read the attached .pdf file for more information on the project.
