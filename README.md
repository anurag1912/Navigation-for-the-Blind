A system designed to aid free and fearless movement of the visually challenged in seemingly unknown environments.
The system uses a GPS module, digital compass for orientation, ultrasonic sensors and vibrating motors for feedback. 
The system is built using the Gumstix Verdex Pro platform running a flavour of Linux RTOS on the ARM processor.
Designed kernel modules for interfacing the sensors and actuators with the MCU.
